# DATA CLEANSING AND NORMALIZATION OF DANE DATA ON PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IN COLOMBIA

With the participation of the ONCE Foundation from Spain and the University of Antioquia, the project aims to access key indicators related to the integration of people with disabilities in the labor market, along with other complementary analyses. This is achieved through the creation of a data normalization model, encompassing data cleansing, to characterize the population with disabilities in Colombia. The project utilizes secondary sources such as databases and statistical reports from DANE. The subsequent visual representation of this information on the [ODISMET](https://www.odismet.es/banco-de-datos/colombia) web platform serves as an exercise in knowledge dissemination, highlighting requirements for interested audiences. The primary goal of this project is to contribute to the observatory and be an active participant in its initiatives.
